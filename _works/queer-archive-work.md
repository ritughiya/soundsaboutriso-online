desc: Urgency Reader 2 is a risograph-printed assemblage of work produced during the COVID-19 shut-down in March and April 2020, published by Queer.Archive.Work. The open call for work was motivated by two desires– 1—to collectively document some of the extraordinary conditions, dynamics, and emotions being experienced while in quarantine, and 2—to provide some relief to artists and writers impacted by the crisis, in both creative and monetary forms. How might publishing as artistic practice embody communal care?
