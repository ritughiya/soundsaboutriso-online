desc: Androgynous angelic beings emerge from blinding white light. A commanding voice booms from an unknown source. The veil of everyday reality is lifted to reveal primordial worship rituals performed by beings both monstrous and divine. Shadowy figures emerge, identities obscured, displaying mysterious powers. Terror and ecstasy bind together in an overpowering force that destroys all sense of time and space. Identity dissolves, surrendering to love and fear of a power beyond comprehension.”, , An Unknown Power features commissioned artwork from twenty two artists from across planet earth, responding to the theme of ambiguity in spiritual encounters, religious icons or worship imagery. – Mega Press and Neoglyphic Media, , Edited by Cullen Beckhorn and Panayiotis Terzis., Print Design and Production by Panayiotis Terzis.
