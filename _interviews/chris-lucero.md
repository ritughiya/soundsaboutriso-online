q2: After I found out about Photoshop, I almost always make my final illustrations digitally. Final output can be any medium, but it has mainly been a combination of Riso and digital printing. As for paper, maybe it's because I like it too much or because I ordered a lot, but my go-to stock is French Paper Speckletone (any weight).

q3: I usually just do the entire sketching, and brainstorming process digitally. If I can't get it right, I would resort to drawing incoherent sketches in a notebook until I get something that makes sense. If I'm drawing people, I start posing in front of a mirror/camera to get the right angles.

q4: Old Man Days is a series I started 4 years ago. I was feeling bored out of my mind at the time and started channeling it all by drawing a full-page layout of an old man doing mundane activities. It evolved into a series of zines exploring this character's everyday life. The print series is a compilation of all the full-page layouts created for each zine's inner cover.

q5: Really plan ahead for the final look of your print/zine/etc. This would really inform how you color separate, organize, and produce the project. You can save a lot of time with a little bit of extra planning.
