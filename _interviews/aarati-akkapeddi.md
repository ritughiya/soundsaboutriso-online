q1: metallic gold on dark paper. cornflower. Fluorescent pink or orange. I'm really curious about Mist but have never tried it!

q2: I produce a lot of my work with code. The process of separating colors also happens more often with code than in photoshop or another software like that. I use python to produce and manipulate my files for print. In terms of deciding colors and materials, I really just experiment and see what supports my concept the best! Touching paper really helps!

q3: My work looks at personal and institutional archives to explore how identities and histories are shaped by different methods of collecting, preserving, and presenting data. My starting point is always with some form of dataset/archive and understanding my connection to it.

q4: These prints were part of a larger project called After Image involving an archive of Tamilian Studio photography called the Studies in Tamil Studio Archives and Society and my own family photos from Chennai. I was interested in finding a space between collective and individual identity,  particularly with these family photos which were so personal, and yet you can kind of find certain stylistic similarities in pose and composition. I also wanted to highlight the complexity of the image as a data point. These particular prints are averages of similar photographs from the archive (and occasionally my own family photos). So for example, all of the images of couples standing, where the woman is on the left are blended together to create one print. Another print shows all of the images where one person is sitting and the other is standing blended together. Another shows all of the images where a child is leaning against a table with flowers blended together.

q5: I'm actually kind of a risograph noob. I mainly learned what I know from my friends over at txtbooks.us! But as someone who's relatively new to it, having open expectations of what the outcome may look like has been helpful. I really enjoy the experimental relationship I have with printing! I'm not sure if it's the medium or because I'm new to it. But it works for me regardless and is a wonderful change from the rest of my process which tends to be digital and code-based.
