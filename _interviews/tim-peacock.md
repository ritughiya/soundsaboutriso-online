q1: Teal+Red~50% and Fluorescent Pink+Orange 100% for a real color blast

q2: My process is most often with a traditional scanned in ink drawing but always ends up digital for color separations in Photoshop., , There are so many ways to approach Riso color, but I often like to approach it sort of like watercolor washes. The thin layering of a few limited colors can create an amazing variety of colors, depth, and texture. I always like to try and blend two primary colors together to make a secondary color as opposed to just using the secondary color because it adds a richness to it that only Riso can. To use my current piece as an example, the orange color is actually the exact same color layer printed both red and yellow on top of each other. , , The way I separate color is by using layer masks on the a flat color layer using the Riso colors that I have available to choose from. That way you can manipulate the opacity of the masks on the color layer but then you can just swap out the color on the layer and see how it affects the image. (Make sure you have all your color layers set to multiply for a more accurate read on what it will look like) And then when you are ready to send it to print you can just convert that color to black, which how Riso machines accepts seperations.

q3: Most of my work is inspired through narrative and my love for comics/cinema and storytelling in general. With a lot of my prints I hope try and capture a moment in  a world that lets viewers build their own story around it., Design-wise with prints, I also try to think about how things would look as decorative art on someones wall and whether an idea/composition seems appropriate for that.

q4: Usually and idea evolves out of my general interests and then I usually put a sci-fi/fantasy slant to it. I just like to draw stuff I like pretty much.

q5: -Blend colors for more richness and depth, , -Donâ€™t go too thick in density for , overlapping colors as they can not mix well and can make puddles/buckle your paper, , -I often used scanned in Riso texture when building my digital color composite to have a closer approximation of what it might look like, but then make sure to take the texture out before I send it to the printer to not lighten the opacity of the color on the physical print. No matter what you'll never be able to perfectly replicate/predict what a print wil look like exactly!

q7: These are things I've learned specifically through my approach to printing. You'll never know what will work and you just gotta go for it. , , Riso is a fun and exciting medium but be ready to accept the imperfections and frustrations that come from an analog printing process. These things are part of what makes it beautiful. , , Good luck!,
