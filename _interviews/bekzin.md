q1: I'm really into the deep green color that 'Teal' and 'Yellow' make these days. It gives a nice grain and the right level of saturation. It was the perfect shade of green for the avocados.

q2: Since it's a cookbook inspired piece, I decided to go with C(teal)MYK to give lively colors for the food images. I drew all the food part in full colors and separated them into CMYK layers. For the other part, such as background and texts, I made sure to keep the colors as monotonous as possible, so that way, it doesn't overpower over images and lose its definition.

q3: The book of Avocado Toast is one of more personal pieces. The idea started from my mother's recipe scrapbook that she has kept for over 25 years. My mother sometimes sends me images of recipes from her collection, which I find very satisfying to watch. The way she wrote a bunch of memos on the printed texts makes me feel like I'm watching the moment when she was learning the dish. I liked how her note made the recipe very personal, so I decided to use the segment to introduce my very personally special dish, Avocado Toast.
