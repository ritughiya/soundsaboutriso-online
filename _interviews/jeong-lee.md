q2: i am a helpless baby boomlet millennial, so usually i jump back and forth between the traditional and digital even within one work. Often times, because of my spotty craftsmanship, i rely on digital processes when it comes to color separation/binding/compositional decision making. Usually i try to collage/superimpose both the digital and traditional processes for the fun of it (and sublimity)
