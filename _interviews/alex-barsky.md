q2: I have some thematic areas I often explore like humanity's relationship with nature and questioning if it's possible for them to live in harmony, or if it's even possible for humans to live in harmony with one another. I feel that I tell the same story over and over again with a different cast of characters, which is basically a person or people trying to come to terms with the bad parts of their own natures and how that affects the ecoystems surrounding them.

q3: Distant Summer was created for Zine Hug's postcards for solidarity project, which aims to raise money for charity while facilitating analog communication during social distancing.  I tried to encapsulate specific thoughts I've been having during this period of quarantine into single images.  I don't know if I have ever felt so many emotions while looking at a banana turning brown before.

q4: I think a good tip for riso and life in general is keep things simple.  It's possible to go crazy with printmaking and you definitely should sometimes.  But generally I think its good to keep simplifying things (from color selection, page count, binding, etc) as much as possible in mind!

q5: Thanks for reading. If you're curious about printing with riso, it's easy once you get the hang of it, and super fun to try! It's a eco-friendly & inexpensive way of self-publishing beautiful & unique artwork =)
