q2: The biggest tip I could share about my technical process would be a focus on not being afraid to let the tools & process I am using being very visible in the final work. I'm not all to invested in the idea of a right or wrong way to do things. But I am very invested in the conversation between my ideas and the tools I have access to. A lot of my decisions for things like paper, binding or color are based on just iterating with what I can get my hands on and trusting my gut when it comes time to make the final call. But when I can't get my gut to cooperate I'm happy to have a loving community to lend me a hand.

q3: My creative process is honestly a mess but I have noticed 3 things that have been generally consistent in getting me to be creative in fulfilling ways., 1. Reading a lot, specifically reading from a very diverse pool of authors, topics, & genres., 2. Letting myself be bored. Anyone whose been frustrated by suddenly having ideas as they are about to fall asleep knows what I mean., 3. Having conversations or sketching. I group these two together because I feel like they both fall into iterating, the only difference is one is auditory and one is visual.

q4: Coffee, honestly I'm addicted and it's bad. But seriously I don't remember what exactly inspired this piece but a lot of my work is inspired by the objects and imagery that we surround ourselves with, that we invest a lot of ourselves in, and I just have a very sentimental soft spot for the sounds of a Percolator first thing in the morning.

q5: Risograph is perfect for being spontaneous and free specifically because its so restrained and limited. A lot of people shy away from limitations because they think it hampers them but the reality is limitations are what produce creativity and the Risograph is a perfect testing grounds for that kinda thinking. I've gone into so many projects on Riso hoping for a desired outcome just to be surprised by something unexpected and new as a result of playing with the limitations.
