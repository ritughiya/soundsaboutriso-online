q2: 1. I never work one way or the other- sometimes I'll make a piece completely digital while others I'll go back and fourth between digital and analog. The final product and method of execution is always influenced by the story and the "feeling" involved. , , 2. For this zine I first sketched it all out on paper, then used a tablet and photoshop to draw out the line work for each panel. Then I printed out the draft with a super light grey using an inkjet printer and went over the lines with pencil. I then take the pencil line work and I scan it so that the outlines are separated before I color everything. This step is super helpful during the color separation process. , , 3. I wanted the zine to feel very delicate so I used thin paper for the cover and the inside. I matched the pink heart on the cover with pink staples â˜º

q3: 1. Honestly it's so hard for me to just sit down and draw- I always feel the need to have a story or a concept in mind before I start and it's so elaborate in my head but when I translate them into comics they never end up going over more than a few pages. I've made it work like that most of the time though. , , 2. I find that I think of most of my stories while riding the train/bus or walking somewhere. Sometimes it's not fleshed out, sometimes its just a specific feeling that I want to convey.

q4: When I was drawing Handle with Care I kept thinking about The Simpsons opening credits so this comic was definitely inspired by that.

q5: ALWAYS give yourself more time to print and troubleshoot. I rarely finish printing in the time that I expect to and always run into some things I need to change or fix here and there. You just never know with the riso ðŸ˜•Also, don't use paper over 65lb cover if you don't have to (although with print jobs we often print on 80lb cover and it works just fine, but sometimes it just misaligns like crazy. ) One more tip is that if you're printing on vellum like the cover for this zine it's best to print at a lower % of black since the paper is not absorbent. You'll also have to back your vellum paper on to another thicker sheet of paper to actually run it through the machine.
