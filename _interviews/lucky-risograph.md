q2: It's hard to just describe in words but we usually color separate in photoshop by using the black & white adjustment layer on the original image and overlaying a color preview with a few blending options to see how the colors mix. We then do all of our layout in illustrator, because sometimes one person has to prep the file and the another person has to print- it's also always helpful to name things accordingly.

q3: We do a lot of workshopping- sometimes we'll be inspired by a certain type of paper or color combination. It's also always super insightful and invigorating to refer to our bookshelf where we keep a lot of books and prints we've collected over the years from fairs and online stores. Our collective style definitely is inspired by our shared passion for random things such as food packaging.

q5: If you're new to risograph- have a print buddy ☺ it's always less daunting to have another person with you while printing. It's also like having a work out buddy to spot you in case your throw out your back lifting those drums. , Other more specific tips- print with interval on and at the slowest speed for consistency, don't use paper thicker than 80lb cover, and always test the paper first before you print it.
