q1: It's always changing! I love the fluorescent orange that a 25% yellow value and 100% fluorescent pink make. But I also love a good deep purple with Blue, Pink and yellow combined.

q2: I color separate using spot colors, not CMYK! I work entirely digitally, plugging my computer into the Riso and printing straight from PDFs. I love to use a smooth, off-white paper, which tends to harmonize the Riso colors well.

q3: A big part of my creative process is starting out with several sketches of random shapes, which I slowly mold into something coherent. It's kind of an improvised drawing experience which helps me discover what I'm interested in drawing in this moment in my life. I do a ton of this pre-sketch process and from those sparks of ideas I find the concept for my piece.

q4: I'm hoping to work generally in the theme of women represented in fantasy and adventure genres. Sometimes I stretch that, but I want to create more work for girls and women to see themselves in these genres, and for them to know it's been drawn by a woman. That's powerful to me and it keeps me excited about drawing and working creatively.

q5: Leave blank space where the feeder grabs your paper to prevent inky roller marks! Print with intervals on, it helps keep consistent registration. I like to print on the darkest density with the slowest settings so the drum has all the time it can get to press as much ink to the paper as possible- I always want that true 100% pink!

q7: Riso seems daunting at first but you get the hang of it quickly! It's just as satisfying as painting, just broken down into layered value combinations. It's actually trained me to see color and values in a completely different way, which helps with my non Riso work!
