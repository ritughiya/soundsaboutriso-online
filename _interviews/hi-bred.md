q2: I try to let my concept drive my technical processes as much as possible. Aesthetics factor into every choice, but functionality is important to a quality piece. My paper choice depends not only on the finished look, but how it will receive the colors I want to use, and what type of binding I want to use if I’m making a book. The binding depends on the number of pages in the book, weight of the paper, cost, and functionality. When I collaborated with Floss Editions on an animated flipbook, we had to find a paper that was springy enough to flip well, but was also thin enough so the book didn’t get too thick. We also had to order a special stapler that could punch through 70 pages of heavier weight paper (over 0.75” thick) because the first one we tried didn’t work.

q3: I am often asked how I come up with ideas but I don’t know if there is a coherent answer. I can say that many of my prints and books have started as a pencil sketch in a notebook. Even though most of my work ends up in the computer eventually, it is very important to sketch with a pencil. For some reason, my hand and mind are much freer and I am able to be more dynamic than I am with a digital tablet.

q4: This piece was inspired by a painting I saw at an exhibition at the Cleveland Museum of Art. It’s called Gabrielle d’Estrees and One of Her Sisters in the Bath. There is a more famous painting with the same title and a very similar scene, but I like this one a lot more. The gesture of the two women depicted is very strange and it appealed to me, so I took a photo to record it. I don't remember if it was immediately or later that I got the idea to produce a new image where I borrow the gesture and invent everything else. I love looking at Renaissance paintings, I love the clothing and textures depicted in them, and the colors I see in them remind me of some of the colors I can get with riso inks. Copying masterworks is a very well-established method of improving your technique, and I believe that working in this tradition pushes my work in new directions.

q5: Overlaying different color inks at different values is a great way to get more out of the riso.
