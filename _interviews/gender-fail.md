q2: I am not a technical printer at all and have never printed more then one layer at once. The reason I like Risograph is because of how cheap it is to create works while also having a certain low-fi imperfect beauty.

q3: Risograph printing is a means to an end for me as a publisher. In thinking of a publishing project, my main interest is the work I am producing rather than the means it is being produced in. As a publisher working mostly with text, it's strange that I risograph my books at all. This all being said, riso does add a quality to my projects that allow the words to pop out more than a digital or offset press. Risograph project also help to enforce that these are hand made object made with love, labor and not a machine.

q4: GenderFail does react to the current moment we are through an intersectional queer perspective. My most recent project, GenderFail Reader 2 (not risograph but printed on demand) includes essays created during March-April reflecting to the Covid-19 Pandemic and it's effects on creative production and form of resistance. A lot of my writing has been based around my ongoing work with "Radical Softness as a Boundless Form of Resistance" and researching into alternative forms of protest outside the public sphere.

q7: Since this is a risograph related project, I want to reinforce that I see risograph and risograph printing is a means to create my projects. In the risograph community, I see an emphasis on process rather than the content being produced. As someone who comes from a printmaking background, I would often feel frustrated by the emphasis on the printing process rather than the work being created. This, of course is not necessarily a bad thing  and that loving the process of printing can be a very beautiful thing. As an artist I gravitate to project that are fueled by intention rather than process and I don't see that enough in the riso community sometimes. I don't identity as a risograph printer but an artist who uses risograph to produce my project. To me its a tool, an imperfect beautiful tool.
