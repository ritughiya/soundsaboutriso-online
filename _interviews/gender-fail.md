q2: I am not a technical printer at all and have never printed more then one layer at once. The reason I like Risograph is because of how cheap it is to create works while also having a certain low-fi imperfect beauty.

q3: Risograph printing is a means to an end for me as a publisher. In thinking of a publishing project, my main interest is the work I am producing rather than the means it is being produced in. As a publisher working mostly with text, it's strange that I risograph my books at all. This all being said, riso does add a quality to my projects that allow the words to pop out more than a digital or offset press. Risograph project also help to enforce that these are hand made object made with love, labor and not a machine.

q4: GenderFail does react to the current moment we are through an intersectional queer perspective. My most recent project, GenderFail Reader 2 (not risograph but printed on demand) includes essays created during March-April reflecting to the Covid-19 Pandemic and it's effects on creative production and form of resistance. A lot of my writing has been based around my ongoing work with "Radical Softness as a Boundless Form of Resistance" and researching into alternative forms of protest outside the public sphere.
