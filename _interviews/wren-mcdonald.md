q1: Hmm, it's hard to say. I think it depends on the project and what's accessible. I like how combos like Blue, Yellow, and Fluorescent Pink can be layered to make a wider range of colors.

q2: For the line work, I go back and forth between digital and traditional, but the color is always done digitally in Photoshop. I keep each color and each opacity in separate layers, grouping everything by color. I like to use opacities because it helps me to think of the image in the same way the Riso interprets it. After I'm happy with the color, I convert to grayscale and then print.

q3: I thrive within the limitations of Riso, especially in a world where I'm constantly bogged down with decision fatigue. There's not infinite colors, textures, sizes, etc. So when I'm working on something that will be Riso printed it's always nice to sit down and see what's accessible. Riso printing has informed my practice in general. Even when working on digital or editorial work, I tend to approach it in the same way--limited color and texture.

q4: This piece actually grew from an editorial illustration. I had to draw a futuristic cityscape to accompany an article about a tech company that had a strong future. Using the foundation of the city, I reworked it to talk about a topic more personally interesting (esp. as someone who lives in New York)-- constantly being barraged with advertising! Also, I just love drawing hovercars.

q5: When working on something that's to be Riso printed, I've found it's best to keep the printing process in mind. Make work that will compliment the process as opposed to forcing the process onto disconnected work.
