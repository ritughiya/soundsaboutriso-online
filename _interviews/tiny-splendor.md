q2: This type of image I have been making is composed of scans from one of the first color scanners available and hand placed pixels. The scanner is designed to run on an Amiga computer and conveniently scans one color of the image at a time - so the separations are basically built into the final scan. The beauty of this process is that the resolution is low enough that the Riso can cut the pixels directly into the stencil - similar to how they would be displayed on a computer monitor.

q3: I started to notice correlations between early computer art and color separation technique for printing. And even more specifically Riso printing. Because in both instances you are working in a limited color space and having to adapt the artwork accordingly. The main difference is that in early computer art you cannot use color overlap and are rather putting colors next to each other and by their proximity your eyes mix them to create secondary colors. So in order to recreate this effect with riso it requires printing a lot of colors.

q5: Use what you can - you don't need a lot of color to get good results. Try to get as much out of each color as possible through overlap - your work will look better and you will be saving time, money and resources.

q7: I hope everyone reading this is in good health and keeping busy as much as possible at this time! It is important to keep producing whether you are an artist printer or creator. Use what resources you have and make the most of them. The more people who are printing and producing the better - this is what keeps Riso printing alive.
