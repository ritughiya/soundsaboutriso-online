q2: Lil WeTransfer is a very chill collaborative venture. We work across mediums, though most work is born as a digital sketch. The collaborative nature is totally free-form—sometimes this means we bounce a PSD back and forth, sometimes we have a conversation and one of us builds out the idea. There are no real set approaches or ways of working!

q3: A lot of our ideation begins as “What if...” statements. That’s really how all of this began. “What if we DJ’d a friends party?” “What if we made merch?” “What if we snagged a college radio spot?”

q4: This poster came from a drop we imagined for our live sets, “We are us, who are you?” It’s nonsensical and a riff on the “We” of our moniker.
