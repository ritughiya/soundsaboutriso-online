q2: My process involves a mix of traditional and digital techniques. I start by drawing on paper and then scan the final into my computer to color on Photoshop. If I feel stuck on the colors, I'll do a few different color studies before jumping into the final layered colors. Having a riso color chart in front of me as I work makes things easier ☺

q3: I draw a lot of things inspired by my daily life. I keep a sketchbook to write my thoughts down and draw observations before I forget them.
