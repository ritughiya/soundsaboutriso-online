q2: Our colour separation process and decisions regarding colour choice, papers, binding methods depend on the specific project. For colour separating and colour choices, we look at what we are working with and make decisions based on the original image/artwork. Colour separations are a combination of using specific cmyk colour profiles and channel mixing to emphasize/isolate certain hues and create overlays that will work for Riso inks, where they wouldn't necessarily work for process colours.

q5: Here are a few - For multicolour prints, print the lightest coverage inks first to minimize ink smudging and roller marks. - For hard to feed, heavy weight card stock, try printing on sheets that are grain short ie the grain of the paper is perpendicular to the direction of the feed. It tends to be easier this way. - Jogging your paper stack helps paper feeding and registration! - You can achieve some pretty stunning results from Riso printing but remember it is a high speed duplicating process made for 1 and 2 colour printing of mostly line and text, don't expect a perfect reproduction of what you see on your computer screen. Ink smudging, uneven coverage, grainy or big halftones are all parts of the charm of this process.
