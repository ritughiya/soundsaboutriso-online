q2: My process is a mix of analog and digital–I mostly deal with digital files form contributors, but I'll print out all the content and lay it out on the floor. I also mix up direct scanning from the riso bed with digital illustrations or images. The paper and binding are determined by the size of the book, the desired cost, and most importantly, the content. In lōkē vol. 2, I made two mini books to show video projects from a two contributors.

q4: This project in particular is about bringing together artists and designers work across disciplines. I'm always thinking about how to best sequence contributors, and I'm always amazed at how such different works can still speak to each other when placed in proximity. This project is also about the parts and sum of the term "works in progress", and I conducted interviews to discuss work that I found difficult to communicate with images alone. For me, the lōkē project (and the general ways in which I work) is inspired by '60s & '70s artist magazines, and communities of New York artists who cross-collaborated in each other's various disciplines during the same time period.

q7: Thank you! Supporting independent artists and small press is important and appreciated always, but especially necessary now. We can't do what we do without you!
