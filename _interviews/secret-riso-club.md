q2: When printing on the Riso, I always think through the lens of the inks I have for my machine (since I have a limited palette of colors) - how they will overlap, blend, and stand out, and how textures will be used. I play a lot with overlapping and mixing colors in a random way so I can get more unexpected results. My process is a mix of analog and digital that involves playing with drawings, textures or photography, and using them to complement digital designs. , , I usually use paper with weights between 80lb/110lb for printing with 3 or more colors.

q5: Try to be organized when working with files for Riso printing. Separate everything by layer, name it, and make folders if necessary - that will make everything easier once you are ready to export. Very often people get confused when they have multiple elements in the same color layer, and they treat these elements in the same way with the same opacity/texture, but I always recommend treating each element in the same color with different opacities and textures so you can get a more complex final print thatâ€™s not so flat.

q7: Risograph is all about experimentation and not being afraid of trying weird things. There is not just one way to do it; there are many ways and all of them are correct- of course there are short cuts and tricks that time and experience will give you, but the overall process is very straightforward - just separate your colors and print!,
