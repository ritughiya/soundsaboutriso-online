q1: I love how well Riso handles pastel colors, though my favorite will always be simple black ink on light paper.

q3: For me, coming up with a concept is easily the most taxing part of the process. I have a tendency to overthink things, and if I'm not careful I know that I will fall into a never-ending spiral of what-ifs. For the sake of moving forward, its really important for me to choose a path and commit - even if a concept isn't as strong as I'd like, I can usually come up with something unique further down the line to give a simple idea a little more personality. I always have to remind myself that ideas don't have to be overly clever or complex to be strong and lovable., , Sometimes I think its best for me to step away from the canvas to come up with ideas - I like spending time fishing for a vision, that way, when its time to draw, I can be deliberate and focused!, , For this illustration I gathered some reference and did a few studies for the pose. Even though this may seem like an extra step, I found that it spared me hours of noodling around and doing guess work - and I got to learn a few new things which always feels like a victory.

q4: This piece was created for Zine Hug's Postcards for Solidarity or P.S. The aim of this project is for artists to create work whose proceeds go to a charity of the artists' choosing. We hope that P.S. enables artists to use their abilities to help out doing what they do best!, , All proceeds garnered from this particular postcard will be donated to Frontline Foods NYC, which is an organization who purchases meals from struggling NYC restaurants and delivers them to frontline workers - its a real win win., , The illustration itself is a tribute to all of the good folks out there delivering food from restaurants so that the rest of us can stay inside!

q5: When I'm setting up a digital file for a Riso print, organization is super important, every color needs to be separated into its own layer. Unfortunately, I have a tendency to jump from layer to layer as I experiment throughout my drawing process, and if I'm not organized, I'm far more likely to mess up my separations. This usually means that I'll end up having to do some "surgery" further down the line., , Additionally, I find it very helpful to set all of my layers to multiply. This helps to simulate the way the Riso ink will work when its printed - two overlapping colors will always result in a darker color. If I don't set my layers to multiply, sometimes layers will be overlap unintentionally and create a new color that I had not accounted for.
