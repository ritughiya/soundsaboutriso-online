q1: I'd say Fluorescent Pink. It adds a click of light to the page and blends really well with other colors. Sometimes you get a nice new overlay color.

q2: For color choice, I usually have the palette ready in the Illustrator file, but it's all up to what drum is available to use at SVA Risolab (where I go to print). Sometimes I switch to another color as someone else is using or that color drum is broken, but end up with interesting results I would never design myself. , , My zines are mostly in 16-page format, saddle-stitch binding. I use International Paper Springhill White 67lb. It has a nice solid weight, with a bit rough surface, taking Riso ink well. I work in both Silkscreen and Riso, this paper is pretty good for both. , , I'd also like to share my dummy process, it's about finding pagination for the final production file. In the dummy, I'll sketch out the content, then pull out the pages to figure out how to arrange two spreads economically. (IvyZheyuChen_Q2_1, IvyZheyuChen_Q2_2)

q3: All my zines share one simple intention- explore anything for fun and experience. If anything got me curious, or shocked, touched, obsessed, I'll look into it. Each zine is a journey triggered by a random subject.

q4: I was in an Emoji phase you know. Emoji just says so much that words can't say, with all these subtle feelings/ emotions. I'm from China, WeChat is an app we use all the time. WeChat smiley looks really creepy to younger generations, but not to the older. It got me looking into "smiley" in general. The subtle eyes, subtle smile, is it "happy" or a mood of "subtle unhappy"? What do you feel when you look at a smiley?

q5: Don't be caught up in the technical imperfections, it always will happen. And it's actually fine.

q6: Q- What's your story with Dummy Smiley? I mean, it's pretty rough, not like the other issues more put together, why do you do it?, , A- It's a story of change– I used to think I suck at drawing. Trying it as a consistent practice a few times, I'd give up eventually, partly because I think I suck at it. One time I was going through the old stuff and found these dummies made quickly for page assignment before production. Honestly, I felt the drawings are quite wild and good. , , It's not that my drawing improved, it's my eyes that have accepted the drawings. This may sound trivial but actually changed my life, removing the block of self-doubt and self-judgment. The new me thinks the raw and casual quality of my drawing is good enough, and I wanted to share that moment.
