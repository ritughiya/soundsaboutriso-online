q2: Rather than painting and color separating after the fact, I think about what colors I want to use and use digital techniques to paint and layer them individually in Photoshop. This gives me an approximate idea of the final result. Then I make changes based on paper and printing results. I choose paper based on the colors I want or sometimes I just fall in love with a paper color and gear the concept around it.

q3: My work generally all start with an idea/mood popping into my mind. I write first. Either for a zine or just general thoughts around or about it. Helps to put down what I want to express. From there I sketch and plan compositions to help support it.
