q2: I work in Adobe Illustrator so I just separate out all the colors in there. I always use the same paper, french white/natural speckletone, because I love how it looks. And I always feel like, I choose a color combo first and then a whole piece or book is inspired by it. My process is generally all digital even though I do sketch it out sometimes.

q3: I love being inspired by the limited Riso palette and playing with patterns and creating scenes from building upon or repeating objects. Illustrator allows me to move around assets like I am decorating a room. Feels almost limitless.
