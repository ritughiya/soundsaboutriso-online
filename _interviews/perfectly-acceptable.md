q2: It's hard to say because every book is sort of it's own animal. Sometimes, an artist isn't too far along with a project when we start working together, and we can really design the book together; other times they're almost totally done with it and it's up to me to try to perceive the essential energy of the book and design the publication around that., , If we're doing full-color printing, we use digital color profiles for CMYK. I try to pick a palette that can faithfully reproduce the artwork while still giving it a little Riso 'edge.' Trying to adhere to closely to true CMYK ends up looking flat! If the artist is doing separations themselves, colors are pretty much up to them, as long as they don't give me too many colors to print!

q4: Daria and I are always trying to make the most extravagant book that we can. The title we did together before this was hand-sewn with bells sewn onto the book, and featured a two-foot foldout. This time, we wanted to try to go big so you could really appreciate the details of her collages. It took forever to print!
