q1: tough question! We love Light Teal + Red + Yellow. As for a single color, we love Mint!

q2: We emphasize collaboration in our publishing process. We typically do our color separation ourselves because that can be pretty complicated - we use Color Library profiles that we've modified to fit our palette. We decide with our artists what colors we're going to use for a book, or they have a palette in mind when they start the book. We've consolidated our paper so that we're really only printing on paper that is 70# or 80# text stock, or 80# card stock. Our process changes for every book, but for the most part we spend the first half a book's production just sending emails back and forth with test prints, mock ups, palette ideas, cover sketches, etc etc.

q3: We typically have a few artists on a list that we really want to work with, and we're constantly in conversation about new artists that we've found that we want to publish and collaborate with.

q4: This book is our second project with Spanish artist Cynthia Alfonso. We first discovered her work in 2016 and we were enraptured with her abstract poetry comics. We approached her about making her first book, "Behind is Late" in 2017, and we basically asked her to work on the follow up - "The One Who Weeps" - immediately after.

q5: The direction of the grain on the paper is HUGE. If you are making a book, make sure the direction of the grain runs PARALLEL to the spine of the book. This will make printing easier, and the book will close and stay together better. Also - no matter what your way of printing (from the scanning bed, from a RIP, from a PDF, from PS, whatever) make sure you TRAP YOUR COLOR LAYERS PEOPLE.
