q2: There was a span of time when I was thinking a lot about the metaphor of edges, which led me to play around with the ‘Sharpen Edge’ command in Photoshop. I would find existing images and then Shift+Cmd+F ten thousand times. A new image, very pixelated, would emerge from underneath. ‘Sharpen Edge’ applied repeatedly, almost like a chant or spell, would force the image to progress into another realm.,

q3: I like the metaphor of excavation because it denotes layers– narrative layers, psychic layers, layers of risograph ink, and Photoshop layers, too. Drawn at the lowest resolution in photoshop, the pixelated drawings convey forms in their pre-symbolic order. , , By default, as image-makers today we’re always co-writing with machines, co-writing with data, co-writing with algorithms.,  , I work towards–, – drastically altering our contact with these tools, –  re-encountering objects, bodies, and language as strange things, – making odd, bent, overlayed, twisted forms, – using tools for synthesis rather than editing

q4: I wanted to draw a body, which is also a shrine. A container of ultimate power, pinnacles, a queer world at the peak of its ecstatic thriving!

q5: Work with friends, collaborate and let the process guide you – that's how I end up making my best prints. , , Also, people have a deep riso fetish. Be a fetishist at heart when making riso prints – it will show.

q7: this not the moment for detailed work plans, schedules, and deliverables ***, Think about this instead-, , Once we are no longer in lockdown will there be a bigger push for remote virtual work, automation and accelerationist tech ideology? What kinds of labors will that destroy? What will migritude look like?, Once we are no longer in lockdown will the rhetoric of nativists and nationalists tighten borders?, Or does the present moment reveal that our economies and livelihoods are so intertwined we cannot isolate?, How is the present moment going to affect the future of employment, governance and migrant labor?, I fear we will come out of this in a very different world, a more controlled, surveilled and opaque world—a world with a very bitter taste.,
