q1: We are huge fans of Cornflower and basically any other color. It's got a great name, and kind of a perfect tonality for pairing. It does not necessarily mix great, but it's a challenge we can work with.

q2: We like to do all kinds of different printing methods -- some that separate and translate original works into Riso-ready pieces, others that are directly digital and feed into the aesthetic process inherent to Riso printing. Both are fun, just different. In terms of form and process, we either try to be as considerate and realistic in terms of our goals as possible. Or we totally fuck it up make something crazy and kick ourselves the whole time.

q3: When we work with artists we like to give them more or less carte-blance, though we do specify an ending price point and page specs so we can give people an idea of what to work towards. This way, we can kind of emerge from beginning to end with a shared sense of scale. We usually pick a launch date together and then work through any questions they may have, give feedback if desired, and run proofs as needed. When we work for ourselves, we try to workshop ideas amongst one another and strengthen things as they develop. Usually we come up with lots of ideas and only do a few. â˜º

q4: TXTreader #2 invites artists to create short low-stakes single-color zines which are then collated into signatures and distributed both as a collected set in single-book-form, and individually as zines from their respective creators. The books, which function as a grab-bag of sorts, are a nice way to bring a bunch of interesting artists together into a single "space." Our hope has been to create more fun in a less monumental fashion and to create more manageable printing for ourselves without sacrificing interest overall. This project has been one of our favorites and will be continuing into TXTreader #3, which will be a "Video Games" themed edition.

q5: Free yourself from perfection as a concept... like it's just not gonna happen with Riso. You may get close but don't kick yourself over registration mishaps -- Especially if you are working with used or repaired equipment. There is what a commenter on Riso Slack referred to as "an arms race" in small press publishing where more colors and more complicated print methods create a race for perfection which can obscure the point of the scene, which is at its core about ideas and distro and a sharing-centered ethos. So translate that into mindset and don't let a perceived race towards professionalism in the scene obscure your wish to create or take part. There is a place for every project. Also, publish with friends! It is much more fun and easier to maintain if you take the journey with others.
