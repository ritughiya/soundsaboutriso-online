q2: Since I was doing a 4 color (CMYK) print, I color separated by using the CMYK channels, and assigning each channel to one of the colors I was using. That allowed me to explore how different ink colors would affect the overall look and tone of the print—for example, whether I wanted my Cyan to be blue, cornflower blue, or mint. When printing, I also reserved the black layer for last so I could get nice crisp edges—though I liked the white background so much that I almost left it like that! For paper, I just used what was available and recommended by the good folks at Lucky Risograph but it turned out well.

q3: I'm really passionate about archival design and ephemera, so I always look to the past when starting a new project. I also love to spot visual themes and create patterns.

q4: This piece emerged out of a collection I had been periodically adding to for a while of old jello advertisements / recipes. At some point, I had collected a couple dozen, and had the idea to arrange them into some kind of set. It's definitely part of an overall theme in my work of collage and using found material, but arranging it in a way that lends a contemporary eye.

q5: I'm still very new to Riso so I'm afraid I'm no expert. I think going in with an open mind and embracing mistakes is a good place to start!

q7: When I first created my print, I didn't know if anyone would like it or if it was worth the time, but decided to do it anyways to learn about the process and because I wanted it for my own wall. To my surprise, people really connected with it. It's a good reminder not to be afraid to try something new and make what you're excited by!
